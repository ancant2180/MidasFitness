# MidasFitness - To Build a Better Fitness App

There are many fitness apps availible at the moment that allow you to keep track of your training goals. However, there are not many that keep proper accountability, or direct people to healthy habits, the hardest to change being diet. Therefore, we believe that by suggesting a diet plan alongside required physical activity, our application will be easier to stick to, resulting in an increase in met goals.

MidasFitness is a JavaFX application using the Eclipse IDE.  It is a fitness app that gathers user information, such as hight, weight, and activity level, and creates macronutrient and caloric goals for users to follow and meet their weight-loss or weight-gain goals.  The application also provides meal plan and workout plan suggestions based on user information.  These recommendations are intended to give users a guide to follow to make retention higher and easier to manage.
